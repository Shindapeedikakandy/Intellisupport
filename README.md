# IntelliSupport — Prototype

Minimal prototype for the IntelliSupport customer support agent.

## Quick start (local)
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a Python virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`.
4. Run: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`.

This repo contains a very small backend prototype with triage, KB retrieval, response generation, and a ticket API stub.
